## Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Website

Udacity Nanodegree: Full Stack Developer (Project 1)


### How to run

    python index.py

This will create a simple http server (to allow serving of CSS and JavaScript from separate files)

The default port is 8000, however you can specify your own like so:

    python index.py 8080

You can view the resulting website at the [demo page](http://pythonic1.github.io/udacity-movie-trailer-website/public/)


### Notes

* Separated Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Python functionality located in `/fresh_tomatoes`
* Movies created from `/data/media.json`
* Used pep8 as a Python style guide
* Removed Bootstrap and jQuery
* Created new HTML (files in `/templates`)
* Created new CSS (using Sass, source files in `/styles`)
* Created new JavaScript (including creation of modal for trailers)
